local-storage
I don't understand the way to apply it to the code at all (at least I get the concept(maybe)) so imma keep it simple in the code.
In save session, get the input value as a variable then use if else to check if it's empty or not then label the value that we want to use(input value from earlier)

localStorage.setItem("savedName", name);
                        ⬆⬆⬆⬆        ⬆⬆
                        label      value

Load session, get local storage value as a variable(agian) if it exists then set textcontent as what it is.

cookies

For setting cookies itself seem to be nothing at all. Main attributes that needed to be focus are name, value, days 
name = label, value, days = expire date. What has been added is path=/ which make these cookie available anywhere in website.
